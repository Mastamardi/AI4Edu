AI4Edu – Empowering Education Through Artificial Intelligence

Introduction:
AI4Edu is an innovative platform designed to revolutionize the way students and educators interact with study materials. By leveraging advanced artificial intelligence, AI4Edu automatically generates concise summaries, smart flashcards, and interactive quizzes from uploaded documents such as PDFs, Word files, and presentations. Our mission is to make quality education more accessible, efficient, and personalized, helping learners understand complex topics, retain information better, and track their progress with ease. AI4Edu supports multiple languages and offers real-time translation, making it a versatile tool for diverse educational needs. 

Problem Statement:
Despite the abundance of educational resources, students often struggle to efficiently process, understand, and retain large volumes of study material. Traditional learning methods can be time-consuming and may not cater to individual learning needs. There is a need for an intelligent system that can automatically summarize content, generate study aids, and provide interactive assessments to enhance learning outcomes and make education more accessible and effective for everyone.

Proposed Methodology

1. User uploads document (PDF/DOCX/PPTX/TXT)
2. System extracts and preprocesses text
3. Text is tokenized and segmented
4. AI models generate:
   - Summary
   - Keywords
   - Flashcards
   - Quiz questions
   - (Optional) Translation
5. Results are aggregated
6. User views outputs in an interactive dashboard
